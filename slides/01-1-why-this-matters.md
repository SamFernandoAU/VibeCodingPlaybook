# Why this matters?

*AI-assisted coding is accelerating software delivery*  
*New agentic development paradigms emerging*

## 🚀 The Acceleration

In the past 18 months, we've seen an **explosion in AI-assisted development** — tools like Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Desktop have changed how we write code.

This isn't just autocomplete; we're seeing **agentic workflows**, where AI doesn't just suggest code, but orchestrates tasks, connects to repos, and drafts features end-to-end. This is a big shift in software delivery.

## ⚠️ Critical Questions

While this creates incredible opportunities, it also raises questions that can't be ignored:

- **How do we keep security intact?**
- **How do we stay compliant with ISO or APRA regulations?**
- **What does this mean for code quality?**
- **And importantly, are our teams ready for this change?**

## 🤔 Food for Thought

Think about your own teams — **how many hours have been saved by AI tools this year?** And **how many new risks might have slipped in as a result?**

> *"But while the AI can produce working code fast, accountability doesn't shift. The organisation and its developers are still responsible for security, compliance, and maintainability."*
