# AI Agent House Rules

## 🛡️ Guidelines for Effective & Responsible AI Agent Use

To harness the power of AI agents safely and efficiently, we need clear boundaries and practices. These house rules ensure that AI-assisted development remains productive, secure, and maintainable.

## 🏠 The Six Essential Rules

<div class="house-rules-grid">
    <div class="rule-card">
        <h3>1. Isolate Tasks</h3>
        <p>Limit context window (longer the chat, the more confusing it gets), use custom instructions to maintain focus and clarity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule-card">
        <h3>2. AI Comments</h3>
        <p>Get AI to comment all the way through, ensure the generated code is readable, review manually to understand the logic and flow.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule-card">
        <h3>3. AI Architecture Documentation</h3>
        <p>Generate documentation on the go, use MCP tools for reading and writing wikis, generate mermaid diagrams, MD files for better understanding.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule-card">
        <h3>4. AI Action/Output Logs</h3>
        <p>Get AI to generate documentation on actions taken, change logs, use markdown for AI readability and future reference.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule-card">
        <h3>5. AI Permission Control</h3>
        <p>Ensure AI agents have a clear boundary to operate under, implement blacklisting/whitelisting of commands/tasks for security.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rule-card">
        <h3>6. AI Feedback Loop</h3>
        <p>Prompt > Code > Critique > Repeat. Establish a continuous improvement cycle for better outcomes.</p>
    </div>
</div>

## 🎯 Why These Rules Matter

These house rules are designed to:
- **Maintain Control**: Keep humans in the driver's seat
- **Ensure Quality**: Generate readable, maintainable code
- **Document Everything**: Create audit trails and knowledge bases
- **Secure Operations**: Prevent unauthorised access and actions
- **Enable Learning**: Create feedback loops for continuous improvement
