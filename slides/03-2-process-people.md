    <div class="pillar-card">
        <h3>1. Validate MCP Tools</h3>
        <p>Validate MCP tools for vulnerabilities and compliance, ensure developers stick to a governed set of tools for security and consistency.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pillar-card">
        <h3>2. Continuous Feedback/Improve</h3>
        <p>Developers still matter, get feedback often, focus on progress over perfection. Regular check-ins and iterative improvements are key.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pillar-card">
        <h3>3. Establish a CoE</h3>
        <p>Appoint champions, build a centre of excellence, advocate best practices. Create a dedicated team to drive AI adoption and standards.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pillar-card">
        <h3>4. Red-team Reviews</h3>
        <p>Validate AI-driven pull requests with more scrutiny. Apply additional security and quality checks to AI-generated code.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pillar-card">
        <h3>5. Training</h3>
        <p>Teams still require basic training, mentoring, safe AI use, and compliance requirements. Invest in upskilling your workforce.</p>
