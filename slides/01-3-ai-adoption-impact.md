## ðŸš€ From Autocomplete to Agentic Workflows

> *"If we zoom in on just the last 5 years, the shift is dramatic. In 2020, AI tools were basically autocomplete helpers. By 2021â€“22, GitHub Copilot introduced true AI pair programming. In 2023, generative AI exploded, and in 2024, we started to see agentic workflows â€” AI not just writing code, but orchestrating repos, tests, and pipelines. And here in 2025, this has gone mainstream."*
