# Enterprise Alignment

## 🏢 The Enterprise Reality

AI-assisted development isn't just about faster coding — it's about **integrating seamlessly with enterprise requirements, frameworks, and governance structures** that have been built over decades.

---

## ⚖️ The Compliance Challenge

<div class="alignment-challenge">
    <div class="challenge-item">
        <h3>🔒 Security Standards</h3>
        <p>ISO 27001, SOC 2, APRA CPS 234 — AI code must meet the same security standards as human-written code</p>
    </div>
    <div class="challenge-item">
        <h3>📋 Regulatory Compliance</h3>
        <p>GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS — AI-generated code must maintain data protection and privacy requirements</p>
    </div>
    <div class="challenge-item">
        <h3>🏛️ Governance Frameworks</h3>
        <p>ITIL, COBIT, NIST — AI development must fit within established IT governance and risk management</p>
    </div>
</div>

## 🎯 The Strategic Imperative

> *"The question isn't whether AI will transform enterprise development — it's whether your organisation will be ready to harness it within your existing frameworks."*

**AI development that ignores enterprise requirements isn't just risky — it's unsustainable.**

---

## 🚀 The Path Forward

We need to **reimagine enterprise development** to embrace AI while maintaining:
- **Security and compliance** at every step
- **Audit trails** for every change
- **Governance controls** that scale with AI
- **Risk management** that evolves with technology
