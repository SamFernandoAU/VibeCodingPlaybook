# Common Habits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Reality of Vibe Coding Adoption

Every new paradigm comes with enthusiasm ‚Äî but also with mistakes. With vibe coding, I see the same patterns repeating across teams.

## üîç Deeper Dive: Understanding the Risks

### **1. Over Reliance on AI, No Reviews, Testing**
Some teams treat AI-generated code as production-ready. No peer review, no tests. This is dangerous. AI can be right 90% of the time, but it's the 10% you miss that creates the biggest risks ‚Äî the bugs, the vulnerabilities, the outages.

### **2. Shadow IT/Dev, Bypassing Governance**
Because AI makes coding easy, people outside engineering can spin up scripts or apps without governance. These tools often run outside DevSecOps pipelines, creating serious security and compliance blind spots.

### **3. Poor Prompting, Risky Outputs, Assuming AI "Gets It"**
AI is probabilistic. If your prompt is vague ‚Äî 'make me a login form' ‚Äî you might get insecure code. Without constraints or context, the AI fills gaps on its own, often in unsafe ways.

### **4. Ignoring Security/Compliance Standards**
Many teams forget that APRA CPS 234, ISO 27001, SOC2 still apply. AI code must go through the same secure SDLC process as human code. No shortcuts.

### **5. Erosion of Critical Thinking and Dev Skills**
Finally, there's the human side. If juniors rely on AI for every solution, they skip the hard lessons of debugging and problem-solving. Over time, the team loses critical engineering muscle.
