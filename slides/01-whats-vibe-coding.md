# Vibe Coding

> *"The practice of using AI code generation tools by engineers or use natural language to describe the outcome for the tool to then generate. Developers act as an orchestrator rather than coding line by line"*

## 🎯 The Shift in Development

**When we say vibe coding, we're talking about using AI assistants not just as autocomplete, but as active co-developers.** It's agentic development — where the developer guides with prompts, and the AI fills in large chunks of functionality.

**Instead of writing code line by line, teams are now describing intent** — *'build me an API endpoint that does X'* — and the AI generates code, scaffolding, and even tests. The developer becomes more of a conductor, orchestrating and reviewing.

## 🛠️ Popular Tools

Popular tools include **GitHub Copilot**, **Cursor IDE**, **Claude Desktop** with Model Context Protocol, and **AWS CodeWhisperer**. They make vibe coding accessible to any developer today.
