# Real Risks

## ⚠️ The Perils of Vibe Coding Done Wrong

When mistakes become habits, they translate into real risks. These are the critical areas where unchecked AI adoption can lead to significant problems.

## 🚨 The Five Critical Risks

<div class="risk-list">
    <div class="risk-item">
        <h3>🔒 Security Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>Nearly 45% of generated code contains vulnerabilities (recent Veracode study), prompting patterns that propagate or increase issues, not diminish them. This includes leaked secrets, unsafe libraries, and more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk-item">
        <h3>📉 Poor Quality & Maintainability</h3>
        <p>Code might work today but be unstructured, undocumented, and hard to maintain. In six months, the team can't understand how it works. That's not just tech debt; that's business risk.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk-item">
        <h3>📋 Compliance Failures</h3>
        <p>In financial services, healthcare, or government, you can't plead ignorance. ISO 27001, APRA CPS 234, SOC2 — they all expect software to go through controlled, auditable processes. AI-generated shortcuts won't pass audits.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk-item">
        <h3>❓ Accountability Gaps</h3>
        <p>If something goes wrong, who is responsible? The AI? The developer? The CTO? At the end of the day, the liability rests with the organisation. That means you need clear ownership over every line of code, AI-written or not.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="risk-item">
        <h3>👥 Team Readiness</h3>
        <p>When teams over-index on AI, they may not be ready to respond to outages, bugs, or breaches. It creates a dangerous illusion of speed — until production blows up.</p>
    </div>

## 💡 The Bottom Line

> *"These aren't just technical issues — they're business risks that can undermine trust, compliance, and operational stability."*

The key is not to avoid vibe coding, but to implement it with proper governance, review processes, and accountability frameworks.
